The assay was performed in a manner similar to that described in Bryk et al., Biochemistry (2010) 49:1616-1627 and modified for an online robotics screening system.A solution containing PDH (Lpd=15 μM; DlaT=30 μM; AceE=15 μM) was diluted 2-fold in 100 mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for the assay. Another reaction solution containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 200 μM TPP, 2 mM Pyruvate, 200 μM CoA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NAD+ was prepared. 5 μL/well of PDH solution was dispensed into 1536-well black plates. Next, 50 nL of each test compound (1 mM dissolved in DMSO) was added into each well. After 30 minutes of incubation, 5 μL/well of reaction solution was added.
